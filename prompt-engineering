Foundational Models(self-supervised learning and finetuning):
1. text-to-text model 
2. text-to-image model


Basic Prompt Techniques:
	zero-shot 
	few-shot prompting techniques
	chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting

Advanced Prompt Techniques
	Self Consistency, 
	Tree of Thoughts, 
	Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), 
	Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART) 
	Reasoning and Acting (ReAct).

Model-specific Prompt Techniques:
	Amazon Titan, 
	Anthropic Claude, 
	AI21 Labs Jurassic-2
Addressing Prompt Misuses
	adversarial prompts, 
	prompts that are meant to purposefully mislead models
	prompt injection and prompt leaking, 
	two types of adversarial prompts
Mitigating Bias
	how that bias can be reproduced in the responses generated by an FM
	how biased results can be mitigated by updating the prompt, enhancing the dataset, and using training techniques
